---

 **Jenkins for CI CD**, with:

- CI and CD explained through **realistic labs on a Linux VM or EC2**
- A clear **note** that Docker and Kubernetes integrations will be covered *after learners master them*
- Logical sequencing for a student who has zero prior exposure

## **Pipeline as Code in Jenkins**

---

## Objective:  
To teach learners how to create and manage Jenkins pipelines using code (Jenkinsfile) rather than manual UI configuration, enabling versioned, repeatable, and automated CI/CD workflows.

---

##  Topics for Section 5 â€“ Pipeline as Code in Jenkins

### 5.1 What is Pipeline as Code  
- Concept of codifying your CI CD process  
- Benefits over freestyle jobs  
  - Version controlled pipelines  
  - Reusability  
  - Better collaboration  
  - Easier to review, audit, and debug

### 5.2 Jenkinsfile Explained  
- What is a Jenkinsfile  
- Where is it stored (in your source repo)  
- Declarative vs Scripted syntax  
- Structure of a declarative Jenkinsfile  
  - pipeline  
  - agent  
  - stages  
  - steps  
  - post actions

### 5.3 Creating Your First Jenkinsfile  
- Basic pipeline that prints Hello World  
- Lab: Store Jenkinsfile in a GitHub repo and run with Jenkins  
- Explanation of what each part of the file is doing

### 5.4 Real-World Pipeline Example  
- Build â†’ Test â†’ Package â†’ Archive  
- Lab:  
  - Checkout code from GitHub  
  - Run Maven build  
  - Archive artifact  
  - Email on success or failure

### 5.5 Pipeline Best Practices  
- Keep pipelines simple  
- Separate build and deploy pipelines  
- Use environment variables  
- Use shared libraries (overview)  
- Secure credentials with Jenkins secrets  

### 5.6 Debugging Pipelines  
- View pipeline logs  
- Fail stages intentionally for demo  
- Retry failed stages  
- Use `when`, `input`, `timeout` blocks
